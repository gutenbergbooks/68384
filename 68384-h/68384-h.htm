</div>

<p class="dropcap">In Mr. Cudahy’s remarkable book entitled
<i>The Pawns of Chance</i> there are Sixteen Women
who Did. Its sure success is prophesied on this account,
for of the five novels that have made ten-strikes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
during the past year each has contained at least One
Woman who Did, and in two instances Several.</p>

<p>And right here, before referring further to Mr.
Cudahy’s book, I wish to place on file a modest word
of protest concerning the modern sex novel.</p>

<p>Just now the stage and story-book seem to vie with
one another in putting on parade the Men and
Women who Did for the delectation of those who
Have or May. The motif in all these books and
plays is to depict the torturing emotions that wring
and tear the hearts of these unhappy mortals. The
Camp of Philistia does not boast that there are in it
no People who Did, neither do we deny the reality
of the heartaches and tears that come from unrequited
love and affection placed not wisely. But from a
somewhat limited experience in wordily affairs I arise
to say that life does not consist entirely in these
things, and furthermore that the importance given to
the Folks who Have is quite out of proportion to
their proper place with the procession. There are
yet loves that are sweet and wholesome; there are
still ambitions that are manly and strong. Let’s
write and talk of these.</p>

<p>But still even in spite of a morbid plot and many
incidents that are rather bluggy, Mr. Cudahy has
produced a work that probably will outsell any of the
other volumes issued by Chicago’s Enterprising Decadent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
Publishers. This book has a few positive virtues.
Evidently it is a collaboration. I think the
author has employed some exceptionally bright apprentices
and like Dumas the Elder, Mr. Cudahy
is to be congratulated on the rare discrimination
shown in choosing his help. In literature, as in commerce
or war, much depends on selecting one’s
aides: every good general must be properly reinforced.</p>

<p>The prospectus of <i>The Pawns of Chance</i> describes
the binding of the book as “a symphony in pig-skin.”
And the volume is certainly very pleasing to
the eye. The paper is hand-made—deckle edge;
the illustrations and etchings on Japan paper; and
the portrait of the author that serves as frontispiece is
a genuine work of art.</p>

<p>The space in <span class="smcap">The Philistine</span> at my disposal will
not admit of an extended criticism, so I will briefly
trace the plot, and make a few casual remarks on
the more important situations, trusting that my
readers will procure the work and each read for
himself. For while its faults are many, yet there are
here and there redeeming features, and in the moral
at the close is a suggestion that is worth one’s while.</p>

<p>Now for the story:</p>

<p>James Hunks, known on the bills as Signor De
June, was in 1875 proprietor of a Ballet Troupe.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
The corps de ballet consisted of sixteen ladies who
were personally selected by Signor De June, and
trained by him so that they performed some very
wonderful terpsichorean evolutions. Eight of these
women were blondes and eight brunettes. Surprising
to state, none were over thirty and none under
twenty years of age. But they were all Women who
Did—that is to say, Ladies with a Past.</p>

<p>Not that they were selected on this account; indeed,
Signor De June did not interest himself in
their Experiences—he only wanted form and intellect—but
mostly form. Yet a coryphee must have
brains, else she could not learn to conduct her airy
shape through the mazy evolutions of the dance.</p>

<p>But it came about by degrees that Signor De
June learned that all of his ladies were Ladies with a
History. And being a philosopher, he reasoned it out
that the ballet was the only respectable calling that
was open to a woman who had been the victim of
misplaced love. Such is the bitter cruelty of a sham-virtuous
society.</p>

<p>And thus on page 141 Signor De June muses as
follows: “Had my ladies been possessed of homely
faces and crusty manners, no temptation could have
come to them, and they would all have lived and
died virtuous maidens; or at best been the contented
(or discontented) wives of farmers, molders, bricklayers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
or mill hands. But being loving and gracious
and sympathetic and withal beautiful, they have been
unfortunate. Furthermore no woman should ever
speak of her virtue unless she hates her husband and
loves another man.”</p>

<p>So Signor De June was very kind and gentle
with these ladies—aye! tender. He loved them all;
he guarded and shielded them from every fierce temptation.
It was a pure paternal love—more properly
Platonic. He only wished to make them happy—that
was all.</p>

<p>They gave exhibitions in the principal cities of the
United States and were everywhere successful. Occasionally
a husband or a former lover of one of these
Women who Did would appear upon the scene, and
whenever this happened the Signor, who was a
large man and ambi-dextrous, would take the offender
neck and crop and throw him out. This always
cooled the most amorous follower, but it kept
Signor De June quite busy. Yet it must not be
thought that the Signor was brutal—far from it: all
were welcome to worship his ladies, but it must be
done from the parquette or dress circle.</p>

<p>So they were all very prosperous and very happy,
until one day the wife of Signor De June appeared
and camped upon his trail. He had gotten an Indiana
divorce from this woman five years before,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
but the courts had pronounced it invalid, and now
she was upon him neck and crop, just as he had
been upon the lovers and husbands. He tried to
explain to her that he loved the Corps de Ballet, not
the ladies individually. He loved them as a Whole,
not singly. Moreover, his love was idyllic—Platonic.
The wife explained that the thing did not exist except
in books, and further stated her belief that the
love was Plutonic if anything; and moreover it
must cease.</p>

<p>No doubt the woman really loved Mr. Hunks. He,
too, had a little regard for her, although they quarrelled.
But he was essentially commercial—a man
of peace. He had no stomach for a legal battle with
his wife’s attorneys, who had taken the case on speculation,
and he could not run away. The woman
utterly refused to be bought off for a reasonable sum,
and she also declined joining the Ballet herself, in
spite of De June’s assertions that he could love seventeen
as well as sixteen, for in love capacity increases
through use.</p>

<p>“Try it for a month and you will see that it is
Platonic,” said De June.</p>

<p>“I’ve no doubt I’d find it so,” said the wife.</p>

<p>She still was firm. He must choose between her
and the Troupe. If he chose the Troupe he’d have
her, like the poor, always with him. If he chose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
her alone she would still resemble the poverty stricken;
but there would come times when vigilance might
relax and he could slip a way.</p>

<p>But what to do with the Troupe! He could not
throw these beautiful, susceptible women on a struggling,
seething, wicked world. He could not put
them on a farm, for who would look after, correct,
discipline and restrain them as he had done? If
allowed to scatter they would marry, and marriage
according to civilized methods, so-called, was a failure;
had he not tried it?</p>

<p>But De June was a man of resource (he was
from Chicago). They were in Denver and women
were scarce. He would select husbands for his
ladies, himself.</p>

<p>He did so, choosing sixteen strong fine young
miners. Calling the men out one side, he made
known to them his plan. Each man was to have a
wife on payment of the trifling fee of two hundred
dollars “matriculation” (<i>Sic</i>). The men were delighted—but
had the ladies been consulted? No,
that was not necessary—there was to be a return
to primitive methods, which indeed were ever best:
civilization was artificial, unnatural and corrupt.</p>

<p>These sixteen ladies were all of fair intelligence,
good hearted, able to work, willing to obey. More
than that they had great capacity for loving, for had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
not this excess of love been their misfortune? The
love only needed proper direction, like all of our
other gifts.</p>

<p>The sixteen gentlemen that the philosophic De
June selected were of fair intelligence, healthy and
good natured, prosperous and all men of fine physique.
There was no choice in the men; there was no
choice in the women; they were on the same intellectual
plane—they were well mated and De June
would not defeat the God of Chance by allowing any
personal selection. One man offered a thousand
dollars for first choice, but Mr. Hunks was a man of
honor and could not be bought.</p>

<p>The gentlemen were to be in the parquette. When
the ladies appeared on the stage, at the word “Go”
from De June, the sixteen men were to make a
rush for the stage and each seize his future wife.
All after the manner of the Romans who captured the
Sabine women—and I guess the Roman Nation is
not to be sneezed at! Cæsar, Antony, Brutus and all
the rest of those honorable men were products of just
such marriages.</p>

<p>The rush was made—the women screamed, some
fainted, but each man held his prize. The electric
lights were turned off, the audience got out as best
it could. Then the doors were locked, the curtain
dropped and Signor De June stepped forward and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
in gentle words assured the sixteen ladies that no
harm should come to them. All had been arranged
for the best. They must be good honest wives, and
the men must be good honest husbands, and Mr.
Hunks, being a Justice of the Peace, declared them
all man and wife—that is sixteen wives and sixteen
husbands.</p>

<p>The women, it must be confessed, had grown a
trifle weary of the De June Idyllic Plan; and in the
good old-fashioned womanly way, oft in the night
season, each had confessed in her own heart, that one
loving husband for each woman was what Nature
intended. So they accepted the situation, and each
began to use those winning ways that Herbert Spencer
says are woman’s weapons: woman conquers
through her intuition.</p>

<p>At a word from De June the women repaired to
their dressing rooms and soon appeared in customary
feminine attire. This time the ladies had to pick
their mates, for the change in dress greatly mystified
the hirsute miners. There was a slight scramble
among the ladies when three of them selected the
same man, but the Signor soon brought order out of
chaos. This scene, which occurs in chapter XXXIII,
is quite dramatic.</p>

<p>All being amicably settled De June gave each
woman a chaste kiss on the cheek, shook hands<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
with the grateful miners and went sorrowfully back
(with his $3,200.00) to the hotel where his Mary
Jane sat up awaiting him.</p>

<p>That night Mr. Hunks and his wife left for Chicago.
There he went into real estate and was very successful.
Having resolved to face his fate, he treated
Mary Jane as gently as he could and she repaid it all
in kindness. So things were really not so bad as the
Signor had imagined.</p>

<p>Ten years passed and Mr. Hunks went back to
Denver and found that the sixteen couples were living
happily. Many little pledges had appeared to
cement the bonds. All were content and perfectly
mated, although several of the men were a bit henpecked—but
a man soon gets used to such things.
(See page 491, line 16). The women having had
Experience were resolved to hold their new found
mates with love’s own bonds; and the men fearing to
lose such beautiful treasures were ever kind. There
was a little doubt in the minds of all concerning De
June’s commission as Justice of the Peace, and then
certain requirements of the divorce courts had not
been fully met, but these irregularities put all on their
good behavior. For it is a fact that if a mortal knows
that his mate cannot get away he is often severe and
unreasonable.</p>

<p>And the curious part of all this is that the story is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
true. Mr. Cudahy protests it on his honor, and declares
that these sixteen worthy couples laid the
foundation for the elite of Denver society, and are
now the leading lights in that beautiful city.</p>

<p>The story is somewhat marred by such ungrammatical
expressions as “has came,” “shouldn’t ought,”
etc. There are also a needless number of French
and Latin phrases, culled from a lexicon I fear, and
a striving after Latin derivatives. It is also a pity
that more pains was not taken with the proof reading,
as exasperating errors are on nearly every page.
Still these are minor points.</p>

<p>In the last four chapters there is considerable symbolism,
which one cannot but wish had been put in
plain English. Like Zangwill’s <i>The Master</i>, the
moral is left for the last. It is a little clouded, but I
take it that Mr. Cudahy believes that civilization’s
plan of selection is very faulty. He suggests indirectly
that Congress should appoint Matrimonial
Commissioners for each district—men of discretion,
experience and judgment. The Commissioner is to
select from society sixteen marriageable young women
and place them in a room, and then take a like number
of young men and let them make a rush, and
this, says Mr. Cudahy, would doubtless do away with
many of our matrimonial misfits.</p>

<p>Lovers of literature will look anxiously for Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
Cudahy’s next book, and in the meantime I am sure
that the Young Decadents will reap a rich harvest
from <i>The Pawns of Chance</i>. I am in receipt of a
letter from the distinguished author wherein he says
that he is positively declining all invitations to lecture
in the provinces, but that he may appear late in the
season in a few of our principal cities.</p>

<p>It may interest the Philistines to know that R. G.
Dun &amp; Co. rate Mr. Cudahy Z Z xxx 1, while
Hobart Chatfield-Chatfield Taylor is only Y x 2 3·4
and Mrs. Reginald De Koven ranks K x 4. At the
present moment I can recall but two residents of
Grub Street who have ratings so high as Mr. Cudahy,
these being William Waldorf Astor and Walter Blackburn
Harte.</p>

<p class="dropcap">An old and worn out Tart once sat on the pantry
shelf and as it dried and stiffened, thus it
soliloquized: “In my youth men fought over me,
not to possess me, but that each should pass me to his
neighbor.</p>

<p>“I was a fair Tart, greatly to be prized, but the
manners of all were such that I was left alone on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
table, the last of my kind, the Manners Tart, and
they all withdrew, feigning indifference.</p>

<p>“The cook, having made many of my brethren,
cared not for me, so I, created to rejoice the soul of
man, sit here, a cold and cheerless thing at which the
rats gnaw nightly.</p>

<p>“There was a little boy at the table, but why speak
of him? He stretched out his hand for me, but
detecting a slight frown between the eyebrows of his
mother, he withdrew it and my chance was gone.</p>

<p>“The little boy was the only one that sympathized
with me; he knew that a Tart is short lived at best;
that the only modest ambition of a Tart is to gladden
some one in life and to overhear a few words of
praise as it passes away.</p>

<p>“But alas! I am a failure, and all because I move
in a circle that makes a merit of self-sacrifice. I do
not understand such things, but——” here a pang of
mold struck to the Tart’s heart and it relapsed into
unconsciousness.</p>

<p>If it had understood it would have said—“there
are many joys in the world that die unrejoiced over
because no man will have the courage to do what he
wants to do.”</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">If the war in the extreme East just ended has done
no more for humanity, it has demonstrated the
unfitness in these days of a nation that has no perspective.
Philosophers we have had, and eke reformers,
who saw no farther than their noses. But
here is a great people whose polity is exclusive,
whose art recognizes no relation of distance, whose
social code is rigidly formal and openly mercenary,
whose methods in war consisted up to a late date of
noise and stenches and hideous banners designed to
frighten an enemy. With rare powers of detail, the
art of China is lifeless and without spirituality or suggestive
force. With centuries of training in literary
industry, its lore is the elaborate repetition of didactic
sayings thousands of years old. There is no background
in its pictures. There is no constructive basis
in its social theory. All is flat surface, repression,
imitation. Yet here is the oldest nation in the world
in continuous history. We need not wonder it has
fallen at last. The marvel is that it stood so long.
The student of history may well ask what has held
back destroying hands through so many centuries of
the world’s unrest.</p>

<p>Lack of a sense of proportion and distance is not
peculiar, however, to Orientals. Even in the light<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
of western civilization philosophers have forgotten
yesterday and to-morrow, and the foreground has
usurped the canvas. Impatience is a sign of modern
degeneration if the oracle who has a caveat on that
warning is good authority. It is strange to find in
the prophet himself the fault he attributes to our
time. For in all ages the world has been on the
point of going to the dogs, according to some voice
crying in the wilderness or on the house tops, as he is
crying now. From Jonah warning luxurious Nineveh
down to Max Simon Nordau listing crooked ears as
the breeder counts his cross-billed chicks as proof
that the race is “running out,” the warning has been
unceasing. And yet the race lives, and builds on its
ruins.</p>

<p>Our nerves have worn us out, according to Mr.
Nordau. If Count Tolstoi knows, amatory passion is
the cause of the wreck, and high feeding back of
that. If Mr. Ibsen is right, artificiality has destroyed
the virtues. M. Zola is sure that bestiality has
brought judgment upon at least one modern Sodom.
Mynheer Maartens is Philistine enough to ascribe
most of our ills to repression of sincerity, of naturalness
in social life. And so a score of doctors describe
special symptoms, each empirically, each truthfully.
The wisest of them—those who have a sense of perspective—see
beyond the immediate ailment the persistent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
vitality which is never wholly conquered.</p>

<p>We have specialized philosophy and literature as
we have medicine. These are not quacks who tell
us the world is going to wreck through the extravagances
of society, through the repression of humanities,
through the lusts of gross living. They are
students of particular phases of distemper. The
world, not the men in its clinics, is to blame when it
hails each as a cure-all. The realism of a Zola or a
Nordau is not a finality. While the knife is in hand
the ulcer is pre-eminently in evidence. Its removal
is the business in order. But the genius of a Zola
that divines the cancer in the vitals of society presupposes
the life that is behind it—and that is the
main factor in his surgery.</p>

<p>He would be a false teacher who should put the
immediate in the place of the permanent in any such
calculation. The world that listens has an equal responsibility.
The greatest artist can only paint passing
phases of the limitless evolution going on about
him. It is heresy in itself fatal to put a phase in the
place of the infinite process. Grant that society is
always at war with itself, always repressing truth,
always promoting animalism by its very more or less
disguises. The paradox of these results can never
be wholly escaped. The teacher who sees what is
and was in due proportion will judge what is to be,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
though no son of a prophet. The new realism for
which Philistines contend is no expose of the evils
of modern society, no uncovering of a witch’s pot.
It holds all these manifestations in perspective, but
substitutes none of them for a general view of life
and human destiny. It would make health instead
of disease infectious, substituting for blind Oriental
imitation a truer standard of custom, freer from convention
that has no warrant of purpose, more direct
in its expression of natural and normal vitality
in personal living and thinking. “From within
outward,” is its motto. It would depose and outgrow
self-consciousness—the vampire fungus that
signalizes arrested development and decay in thought
or in letters or in the self-projection of social life.
The realism of the Philistines is manifested in the
recognition of healthy life that we find in some of
the new literature—in the heroic romance of Anthony
Hope, in the charming tenderness and sweetness of
Maartens’s Hollandais and in the fresh-witted islanders,
full of arterial blood, of Hall Caine and the
wizard who lies buried on the mountain top of his
own beloved island—that second one to the left
after you leave San Francisco.</p>

<p>Even the modern stage, corrupted by French
intensities and the commercial idea of filling the
house, is showing signs of a reaction. Not more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
than nine-tenths of the standard attractions of the
coming season are based on infractions of the seventh
commandment or of that similar law which every
chivalrous man knows, though it was never traced
in fire on the Sinaitic stone.</p>

<p class="dropcap">The publishers of the <i>Chap Book</i> of July 15th have
kept their promise to furnish original matter in
one way perhaps not contemplated when they made
mention of that booklet in their catalogue.</p>

<p>We can rest assured that Tacitus never wrote
“emperasset” in the sentence quoted on page 174;
we shall be slow to believe that the author of <i>The
Children of the Ghetto</i>, in confusion of mind was referring
empire and empirical to a common origin,
mixing up the sons of Aeneas and Danaos after the
fashion of Little Buttercup.</p>

<p>With perhaps a trifle less confidence we may acquit
him of dragging into notice as a prominent name in
English letters the hitherto obscure or wholly mythical
“Carlysle,” who figures on page 177. But in excusing
the writer from the fatherhood of these literary foundlings<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
we are compelled to look to the publishers or at
least to their proof-reader as the responsible man, a
sense of decency no less than the requirements of this
metaphor, repudiates the suggestion that he might
after all turn out to be a woman, and whether the
reproach belong at the door of the principals or of the
workman is quite immaterial to us, the house must
stand the breakage of glassware, not the bartender.</p>

<p>A matter of two typographical errors within the
space of a single short article may seem but trifling
subject for comment in a world where the surest
footed at times slip, but one or two considerations
make even such venial sins fit objects for animadversion.
The publishers of the little fortnightly, in
the manner of their issues if not in so many words,
set themselves up, in a fashion, as guides in the
matter of literary elegance, it behooves them therefore
to take heed that the unwary be not led astray.

BEING SUNDRY BITS OF
WISDOM WHICH HAVE BEEN
HERETOFORE SECRETED, AND ARE NOW
SET FORTH IN PRINT. <img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /></h2>

</div>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> To Robert Cameron Rogers: You are keeping
the stage waiting.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> My friend with the Sharp Scissors which edit
the Table Talk column of the Buffalo <i>Commercial</i>
had a few words to say the other evening regarding
success. He alleged that Mr. Bok and Richard
Harding Davis were successful men, and that it was
the pleasure of unsuccessful people to jump on them
mercilessly. I dislike to disagree with Mr. Quilp,
but it seems to me that he belongs to that class of
people who habitually miss the point of things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span></p>

<p>The story in <i>Gil Blas</i> of the strolling player—true
to what he deemed his art—working with commendable
if misdirected energy, walking from town to
town, and as he walked soaking his dry crusts in the
water of wayside wells—this were a story of success.
Success, it seems to me, lies not so much in having
one’s name a commonplace among this great American
public, which falls down to worship mediocrity
if it is well advertised, as in doing one’s day’s work
honestly and sincerely. To sing a song that finds
its way into the hearts of men; to act a part that
helps another toward his happiness, and do it all
without blare of trumpets and jangle of hurdy-gurdy;
and then walk on to the next town, stopping by the
roadside wells to soak a dry crust in cool water, or,
perhaps, a fresh cake in a mug of Bass as occasion
served, and then, at the end, to lie down quietly,
listening to the singing by the people of one’s own
songs—though they know it not—presents a picture
of a perfect harmony. This is the preachment of
Stevenson and of men before him, and until a better
one may be advanced this will serve. I would
rather have written <i>The Pavilion on the Links</i> than
<i>Successward</i>, or even Mr. Davis’s masterpiece, <i>Van
Bibber and the Swan Boats</i>. Still, it is a matter of
taste, and if one likes lactated food, roast mutton is
bad for his stomach.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span></p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> According to the prospectus Mr. Cudahy’s book
fairly bristles with epigram: the bristles alone are
said to be worth the money.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> Probably Lawrence Hutton knows more about
death masks than any living man. I cheerfully grant
him this honor, but when he writes the advertising
pages in <i>Harper’s</i> and springs them on an unsuspecting
public as “Literary Notes,” I rebel. Rebellion
is not, however, confined to mere objection to his
sailing under false colors, but to such sentences as
these from a recent number of <i>Harper’s</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Beyond the Dreams of Avarice</i> is not as <i>amusing</i>
as an entertaining story, but it is intensely interesting
from beginning to end. No one who picks it up for
an evening’s <i>amusement</i> will be likely to lay it down
unfinished or to lay it aside for any other form of current
<i>entertainment</i>.”</p>
</div>

<p>The italics are mine, and are put in simply to emphasize
the occult meaning of Mr. Hutton, who belongs
to the class which assumes to set the literary
pace of the world. I doubt if Brander Matthews
could do worse.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> The portrait of Mr. Cudahy that is used as a frontispiece
in his new book is a photograph from the original
chromo, signed by the electrotyper.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> It is reported to me that quite a large section of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
the Metropolitan colony sing their jubilate this way:
“It is Howells that hath made us and not we ourselves—We
are his people and the sheep of his
pasture.”</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> “Papa,” said the smart boy at dinner, “does consomme
mean consumed?”</p>

<p>“No, my son,” said the philologic pa, “consomme
is from a Latin word, <i>summum</i>—all—and comes to
us via the French. It means ‘all together’—the
same as the Trilby pose.” And there was silence
for the space of four seconds.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> Somebody has sent me the prospectus of a magazine
shortly to be published in Cincinnati. In spite of
rumors to the contrary <span class="smcap">The Philistine</span> will continue
publication. Even <i>The Century</i>, although frightened,
will let advertising contracts as heretofore. <span class="smcap">The
Philistine</span>, and supposedly other magazines, base
their hopes of a longer existence not on their equal
worth—for lo! it is but timorously we draw breath
after reading this prospectus—but knowing that the
new magazine will be keyed to so exquisite a pitch of
literary supremacy that only a few from the world
erudite may revel in such a rarified atmosphere.
The birth of the periodical—from the prospectus—fittingly
closes this momentous era. Evolution, hitherto
satisfied with minute gradations, now forges<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
ahead in a stupendous leap; we are diatoms, we
scratch rudely on bones, and live in caves; we still
bag the mastodon with embryonic pitfall, we shave
with a shell and are only paleozoic microbes in a
literary miocene age. We are mental fossils clogged
in stratified oblivion—but we can’t help it, we are
rudimentary and still possess some basal instincts
such as love, religion, love of beauty and the like.
But we never imagined how infinitesimal we were until
the coming of that fatal prospectus. Now we realize
that the groaning of the world, the extraordinary upheaval
of the age, the quickening of the leaven, the
quaking of the Zeit Gheist were but the premonitory
travaillings of eternity before the awful nativity of
this infant from Over-the-Rhine. The veil of our
temple is rent and our suspenders are in hock.
Mighty Spirit of the æons have mercy on us! we are
worms! moribund, senile old things. Our ears are
sessile, yet we hear the portents. In this hackneyed,
conventional, sterile age somebody is going to be
original! Prostrate we make obeisance. Spare us
Original that is to be—spare us! But who t’ell
started this Literary Fresh Air Fund, anyway?</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> “Three generations from the soil” may be a good
rule of social eligibility after all. I know a family in
one of our great lake cities which has ruled society
therein for half a lifetime and it is only two removes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
from the mud. But savagery will crop out now and
then, despite all the austerities of social custom and
the perpetual effort to reach the calm of Nirvana and
look as if life was a doosid bore. The delight of
these, as of all savages, is to astonish the natives.
When it can be done by driving a loping team of
circus horses down the chief avenue of the city, that
suffices. Another pet trick is to mass the family on
the porch of the wooden-castled mansion on a Sunday
morning and take their pictures in group, in full
view of worshippers returning from church. The
suggestion of a Ute reservation at such times is complete.
When these fail to create a sensation, a yellow
tally-ho driven madly through the narrowest
streets of the Quartier Teuton, scattering dogs and
babies, with whoops and horns and the mottled circus
horses in the lead, does the business. It isn’t so
long since the richest of our American nobility showed
the craven blood of the materialistic sons of the bush,
to whom brute life is everything. The American-English
duel that failed is still an unpleasant memory.
I mention these things only to illustrate the paradox
of our days. We do labor hard to get rid of the joy
of living and we call the new state culture and repose,
when we get it. But the storage of force is a poor
thing. It breaks out in abnormal ways and the acquisitive
father is punished in his degenerate children<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
to the third and fourth generation sometimes—and
usually to the second.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> I have received the second volume of <i>Moods</i>, which
my Philadelphia correspondent calls <i>Sulks</i>. It is a
retrograde from the first number in that in some
places the printing is on both sides of the leaf. I
had hope that <i>Moods</i> would continue its good work
and in the second number leave both sides blank.
As it is, however, I commend the first volume to that
eminent figurer, Mr. Edward Atkinson of Boston,
who may use the blank sides upon which to calculate
what the other pages are good for. By the way, the
announcement of the second volume contains a description
of the type used, which is a reprint of the
typefounder’s circular concerning the Jenson type. I
would imagine that some of the geniuses of <i>Moods</i>
could have at least written an original circular. The
prospectus of the second volume contains a list
of one hundred and seventeen stars—geniuses of
the first magnitude—still as my friend of the <i>Picayune</i>
says, “Though they twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, we
wonder what they are.”</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> If McClure can give us more such exquisite stories
as the Zenda tale in the August number, a good deal
of reminiscent literature and living documents may
be pardoned. Hope is better than memory, Mr.
McClure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span></p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> Mr. Frank A. Munsey, who prints a picture book,
of which eleven million copies are sold every four
weeks, declares in a shrill, throaty falsetto that
American literature at present is so and so; and that
in the future he proposes to have it <i>so</i>. Mr. Oppenheimer
of Rochester has not yet been heard from.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> I hope no one suspects me of any disrespect
toward Mr. Ham Garland of the Chicago Stock
Yards, heretofore noticed in these columns. A correspondent
reminds me that Mr. G. is favorably
mentioned in the oldest records. The historian of
the creation remarks “And Ham was the father of
Canaan.”</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> Chicago’s <i>Echo</i> should be successful. It is taking
from the foreign periodicals their very best of picturings
and giving us a taste of the delightful fun of
<i>Fliegende Blætter</i>, <i>La Rire</i>, and the rest—a fun
which somehow we cannot produce in America, so
<i>Puck’s</i> artists and those of <i>Judge</i> and a few others
borrow the ideas and we pat ourselves on the back
and say what a keen sense of humor we have. We
are very funny—we Americans—funnier, by long
odds, than we think. I notice, too, that <i>The Echo</i>
knows another good thing when it sees it, so the
editors have made the printers use my pet grape
leaves for the beginnings of their paragraphs. For
this compliment to my taste I thank <i>The Echo</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span></p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> What we are coming to in poetry is always a fascinating
theme—like biking in the dark on a strange
road. But what we are going away from is more
satisfactory to contemplate. It is pleasant to think
that Homer, the blind minstrel, and Omar, the tent
maker, are fixed facts. They are the poles of verse—one
standing for the heroic and romantic, self-unconscious
and buoyant, the other for vampire introspection
and fatalism which mistakes interior darkness
for an eclipse of the universe. It is also consoling to
know that such poetry as Francis Saltus Saltus’s
“Dreams After Sunset” and Duncan Campbell
Scott’s yawp in the August number has been written—for
they won’t have to be written again.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> Judge Grant, in commenting on the ways of the
Summer Girl in the July <i>Scribner’s</i>, says that after
her return to her own particular vine and fig-tree she
has, among other perplexities, “a considerable uncertainty
in her mind as <i>to whom she is engaged to</i>.”
This is in form somewhat similar to the reporter who
said the victim of the trolley accident was killed
fatally dead.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> According to Mr. F. Hopkinson Smith, who parts
his name in the middle and therefore ought to know,
“Abbey in his art really has done what Wagner has
done in music, Tennyson and the poets in verse.” He
says so in the current <i>Scribner’s</i>. Tennyson “and”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
the poets is so kind—with accent on the “so.” The
author of “Locksley Hall” ought to come back to
Lily Dale or somewhere and thank Mr. Hopsmith.</p>

is now known as “The Wind in the Clearing.”</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> I have received from the Department of Agriculture
an envelope labelled “Official Business—Penalty
for Private Use $300.” Stamped across the face
in red ink is the autograph of Hon. D. N. Lockwood.
Inside this envelope was one still smaller which bore
this inscription:</p>

<div class="boxdots">

<p class="center">U. S. Department of Agriculture.</p>

<p class="center">FORGET-ME-NOT.</p>

<p class="center">Blue.</p>

<p>A half-hardy perennial. It prefers
a moist situation, is easily grown and
blooms early.</p>

</div>

<p>If I remember correctly Mr. Lockwood Ran for
something during last fall’s campaign. I wonder
what he is going to Run for next that he wishes
to be remembered.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco1.jpg" alt="" /> New York rejoices in the possession of a magazine
for rich people. It is called <i>Form</i>, and it tells all
about the first families—Knickerbockers and others—and
what they do to be decent. I understand it proposes
to offer prizes after the manner of Judge Tourgee’s
<i>Basis</i> for the cleverest paraphrase of the second
verse in Genesis. The historian of creation declares
that on the first day “the earth was without <i>Form</i>,
and void.” It’s a great “ad.”</p>

Francisco the delegates were treated to a steamboat
ride down the bay where a picnic was held. Police
were on hand to see that the delegates did not all
rush down a steep place into the sea and perish in the
waters.</p>
